# macro-manager
Welcome to my repository! The macro-manager app is designed to allow the user to enter their daily meals, and see a detailed nutrient profile for their ingredients. The data in this project is sourced from the [USDA FoodData Central API](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide), a free-to-use government-run website with very reasonable rate limits.

## Installation Guide

2. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/green4ja/macro-manager.git
